The disaster impacted various areas within Gurjaani, affecting both urban and rural settlements. As a consequence of the heavy rainfall, the central streets of Gurjaani municipality and surrounding areas were flooded, causing severe difficulties in transportation and mobility. In addition, the sudden mudflows and landslides resulted in the destruction of roads, blockages caused by fallen trees, and damage to vital infrastructure such as bridges and power transmission towers. Gurjaani, Chumlaki, Tchandari, Vejini, Dzirkoki, Kolagi, Bakurtsikhe, Kodalo villages were flooded, and other state infrastructure such as bridges and inland roads, and power transmission towers were damaged. The disaster also had a detrimental impact on the agricultural sector, with flooding damaging agricultural lands and destroying crops. This has significant implications for the livelihoods of the affected population, as agriculture serves as a crucial source of income for many households in Gurjaani. During the Gurjaani disaster, the heavy flooding had a profound impact on the affected households. As families typically stored basic household items and food on the first floor, the floodwaters resulted in significant damage to essential supplies, appliances, furniture, and various household items. This loss added to the already challenging situation faced by the affected population"
